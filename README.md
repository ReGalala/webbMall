# Webmall – Multi-Store E-commerce Platform

Webmall is a full-stack web application that enables creators and small sellers to quickly set up their own online store without building a website from scratch.

The platform allows sellers to manage products, inventory and orders, while buyers can browse stores, search products, manage carts and place orders. Webmall handles the technical infrastructure, authentication, and data management.

The project was developed as part of the university course *DIT342 Web and Mobile Development (HT23)*.
